Featured Property Widget is a responsive widget that is designed to fit well on most themes.  The widget will display a property image as well as several details about the property.  Current details are: Type, Beds, Baths, Home Size, Lot Size and Description.  The main image also can serve as a link to another page or external URL that houses additional details regarding the property.
